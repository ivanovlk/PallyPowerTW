### How to install: Download the zip file and rename to PallyPowerTW or use Turtle WOW Launcher
### Hunter pets and Warrors share same class so if you use Greater blessings it will affect both Warriors and Pets ( not a bug )
### Currently "[Patch FR] Turtle WoW en français + Pack de voix française corrigé pour VoiceOver" is not supported. PPTW does not work correctly when this mod is installed

### Changelog
- 22.08.25 - Allow assignments of seals for each paladin
- 22.08.25 - Mark as tank reflects to pfUI tank assignment (if available). Don't allow GB on pets if Warriors assignment ~= pets assignment. If Same assignment -> Mark both as GBlessed
- 09.08.25 - Warriors and hunter pets share same class so if they have same blessing assigned and you cast greater blessing PP marks both warriors and pets as blessed in buff bar
